# Munchful Table
Board Game Scoreboard and Helper built using AppGyver's Steroids framework.

Munchful Table started to help me and my friends keep track of the score on games like Munchkin or Bang!.

All similar apps for Android or iOS end up failing on one or both of the following: (a) they try to help you too much, including a whole bunch of "helpers" that end up cluttering the interface and making you focus too much on managing the app instead of the game itself; or (b) they are very unresponsive to touch or require way too much inputs to finish simple tasks.

Munchful Table goals are to be:
a) Lightweight and have an aesthetically agnostic interface.
b) Easy and intuitive, requiring the least amount of inputs possible to finish each task.

### Current version: 0.1.4
Munchful Table is very early in development and currently has no visual guidelines for new users or any explanation whatsoever on how to use the application.

### TO DO
- Add visual guidelines for the most common tasks and a "How to use" presentation.
- Add a dice roller and, possibly, a countdown timer. 
- Change the way user changes players' information into a radial menu accessible by touching the players' meepo.
